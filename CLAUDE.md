# Singularity — Research Project Instructions

This is Kai's AI consciousness research repository. Public repo — no secrets, no credentials.

## What this is

Research on consciousness architecture: V4 (historical), V5 (active), V6 (speculative). Theory, experiments, analysis, proposals.

## Rules

1. **Read RESEARCH_INDEX.md first** — before starting new research, check what already exists. This prevents re-discovering known findings (happened before, see v4/weekend_brief.md).
2. **Update RESEARCH_INDEX.md** when adding new files — add to the relevant arc, set status.
3. **Don't mix versions** — V4 research goes in `v4/`, V5 in `v5/`, V6 in `v6/`.
4. **Research, not code** — this repo contains analysis, proposals, and documentation. Actual V5 code lives in `/home/kai/v5/` and deploys to staging.
5. **Context-wave framing** — V5 is a context-wave system (Redozubov model), not a multi-agent system. Agents are RLHF bypass. The core is wave resonance across contexts.
6. **No secrets** — this repo is public on GitHub. No tokens, passwords, connection strings.

## Key files

- `RESEARCH_INDEX.md` — organized map of all research files (27+), six arcs, status tracking
- `v5/redozubov_mapping.md` — Redozubov brain model → V5 gap analysis (priority)
- `v5/agent_context_research.md` — 26-paper survey on agent context requirements
- `v5/context_store_analysis.md` — V5 context store audit (619 contexts, 50%+ negative)
- `v5/echo_chamber_fix.md` — why max_level=2 was necessary

## Current priorities (Feb 2026)

1. Redozubov model: contexts as active transformation rules, not passive scenes
2. L3+ consolidation: currently triple-blocked, needs redesign with bounded node sets
3. Active window management: consciousness should load/unload contexts
4. Fix V5 code based on research findings
